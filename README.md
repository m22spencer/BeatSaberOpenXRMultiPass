### Why would I use this?

- Beat Saber only shows in one eye (Not **shaders**. One eye will be completely black/gray or showing bounds)
- You want to use new and old mods with new version (OpenXR) of Beat Saber
<br>

### Installation
- Download the release: https://github.com/m22spencer/BeatSaberOpenXRMultiPass/releases/tag/0.0.1
- Extract and place the dll in your Beat Saber/plugins folder
<br>

### Possible issues
- This only enables multipass for OpenXR. There are three additional XR libraries in the assembly that could be used on different headsets. I am not sure
- Performance hit?  Trivial.
